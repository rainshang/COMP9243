Milestone 1

commonlib.h
--a common lib for both dsm.c and sm.c to reduce code redundancy. Specifiaclly, there are two things worthy to be mentioned,
    --'protocol_write' and 'protocol_read', they implement a protocol above TCP, to make sure one read operation exact the data one write does, for any filedesciptor message delivery, such as socket and pipe
    --'generate_client_msg' and 'split_client_msg' is a protocol above the protocol above, which is to wrap the msg sent from client to server. Server will deny any messages not following this protocol

param.h param.c
--to process the arguments when execute 'dsm'. The struct Parameters is to store the basic arguments when call the function dsm. The function parameters_init() will initialize and allocate the memory for the arguments. The function extract_host_names() will open the hostfile and store all nodes. The main function is Parameters *parse_argv(), which will store all the information from the command line and return the struct. Finally, it also contains log functions, they will write what server and client do to the log file.

dsm.c
--the so-called 'server' or 'allocator'. It fork()s N process to execute ssh command to run the 'EXECUTABLE FILE' on remote(or local) host, wait for the N client hosts to connect back to server via TCP and then runs an infinite loop to listen the sockets one by one and processe them in order. This mechanism is easier to manage the message synchronously than fork()ing N more new processes for the N sockets.

sm.c
--when called by server via ssh it connect back to server and fork()s a new process to listen to the socket infinitely. So there are two process in a client which includes this SM library API. An anonymous pipe is created for the communication between them. For example, in 'sm_barrier', parent process requests socket listening by sending message via pipe to child process. Thus, child process stops reading socket to let parent to handle it. After parent process receives the barrier synchronization message from server, it return the socket listening permission to child process.


Milestone 2

#import a third party verctor lib, https://github.com/rxi/vec

--when 'sm_node_init',
    each node calls 'mmap' to get available shared memory address(sm_addr), then sends it the allocator.
    allocator selects the MINIMUM one as the global shared memory start address, then returns it to nodes.
    every node re-mmap by the MINIMUM address returned by allocator and maybe get a new smaller address (aligned by page_size), which should be same in every nodes.
    then each node sends the re-mmap address to allocator to double check
    allocator checks all the re-mmap addresses, if same, we got the global aligned shared memoery!

--when 'sm_malloc',
    node sends the size to malloc to allocator,
    allocator will count how many pages this malloc needs, using formula '(size - size % pagesize) / pagesize + 1'. This means the unit of sm_malloc() is page, because the mprotect() can only affect on page scale.
    if the size not over bounds, allocator turns the 'unmalloc_sm_addr' to each node one by one and then move cursor(unmalloc_sm_addr) by pages.
    when node receives the address allocator allocates, it save the address information(addr, size etc.) in a list. Of course, the node has the full write and read permission of this address.

--when 'sm_bcast'
    owner node calls 'sm_bcast' and sends its new memory, including the address, size.
    meanwhile, the other nodes call 'sm_bcast', but send nothing.
    when allocator receives all the 'sm_bcast' commands, it recognises the original owner and sends its address and size to other 'sm_bcast' nodes.
    also, the allocator saves the sm_bcast address, the nodes who can read the address and the node who can write it. Currently, only the owner can.
    the other nodes save the valid address and size in the list metioned in 'sm_malloc'. The 'other' nodes should set the address NO_ACCESS.

--when fault sigal of one address generated
    node check the read and write permission
    dsm server will use a queue and lock to store the conflicted read or write requests from clients and ensure the concurrency.
    If there are multiple read or write requests in the same one address(memory), server will response only one request and push
    rest of requests to the queue, and lock the queue. After this request finished, the lock will be released and the queue will
    pop another request to response.
    if !read
        node send read request of this address to allocator.
        allocator checks the address permission struct.
        if one_node_has_write_permission
            allocator ask this node to release the ownership and write permission.
            and this node return the binary in this address.
        else search the read permission list and find the latest read owner
            allocator ask this node to release the ownership and write permission.
            and this node return the binary in this address.
        endif
        allocator return the request node with the binary in this address.
        allocator adds the request node into the address's read permission list
    else if !write
        node send write request of this address to allocator.
        allocator checks the address permission struct.
        if one_node_has_write_permission
            allocator ask this node to release write permission.
        endif
        allocator tells all the node except the request node to release read permission.
        allocator return the request node with the binary in this address.
        allocator set the request node one_node_has_write_permission.
    endif

--struct sm_ptr
    {
        void *ptr;
        size_t size;
        bool has_write_permission;
        bool has_read_permission;
    }
    a struct to save a point and the actual memeory size it represents

--struct sm_permission
    {
        void *ptr;
        int has_write_permission_node;
        int *has_read_permission_nodes;
    }
    a struct to save
    which nodes have the read permission
    and
    which node has the write permission

--'protocol_write' and 'protocol_read'
    not changes much, still following {msg_len}{msg}. Based on socket, to rencognise one valid msg in the stream

--'generate_msg' and 'parse_msg'
    based on the msg protocol mentioned above, the format of msg following {cmd}{data}, in which, {data} is a sm_ptr*. Thus, the data and size will be clarified

--we thought the given demos were just for mileston 2, so we didn't use sigal mechanism in milestion 1......(ノÒ益Ó)ノ
    we refactor the client (sm.c) with sigaction.
